# MiSideRPC

A simple mod for MiSide that adds a Discord rich presence to the game.

This is my first mod so if you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Support

For now the mod only works with English language, but I'm planning to add support for other languages in the future.
